# MIS480-Portolfio-Project
This project was for my capstone project at Colorado State University Global. The project focuses on creating a business intelligence solution for a U.S. Organization. I chose to focus my project on charity organizations and logistic regression analysis in SAS. The data for this project was sourced from Josh Yazeman's blog post on predicting charitable giving. https://joshyazman.github.io/predicting-charitable-contributions/
